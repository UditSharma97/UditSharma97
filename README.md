### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a passionate and driven 3rd-year B.Tech Computer Science student. My journey into technology began with a simple fascination for how games and websites work. This early curiosity, even with limited resources, ignited a drive to understand the mechanics behind the digital world.

- 🔭 I've built my technical foundation primarily through self-learning using online resources, which has instilled in me a strong sense of initiative and the ability to grasp new concepts quickly.

- 🚀 My perspective on technology was recently transformed by an intensive Generative AI workshop with mentors like **Phani Krishna** and **Vaibhav Sisinty**. This experience opened my eyes to AI's incredible potential for productivity and innovation.

- 🌱 My background has taught me the value of resilience, continuous self-improvement, and the energy that comes from genuine curiosity. I'm now keenly focused on the frontiers of Generative AI, AI Automation, and building AI Agents.
